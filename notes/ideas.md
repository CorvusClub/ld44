# Incremental Games
- Sad game about wasting your life on working
- 

- TIME STORIES BUT IT'S YOUR LIFE.

# Murder Mystery
- You are solving an crime in a world where life can be currency.
    - I like the idea of a twist where the person faked their own death to pay for something
        - how do we reveal this?
    - other general cyberpunk shit
    - sherlock holmes consulting detective, you get options on places to visit and ppl to talk to
    - uber for investigating crimes? ppl who can afford it get real investigations
    - the person who killed the victim is his lover?
        - they hatched this plan to make money to get off world
        - the rich asshole wanted them to get away with a specific killing as a flex?
            - they only get paid if they get away with it
            - do you report and get paid?

# THE PLAN
- Volunteer to be killed for the whims of some rich asshole
    - The victim wants to pay for offworld travel for lover
- Make a fake body
    - Hire someone to put them together
- Mutilate the body how the client wanted
    - This helps disguise that this is a fake
- Dump the body in the streets publicly
- Lie low at a safehouse until the money clears
- Escape the planet together
    
Not Detroit Become Human "Did you know they used to take slaves through Detroit via the underground railroad?"

you are an investigator hired by a family who's child has been killed. you're trying to figure out what happened to them. give some clues to make ppl think they killed themselves to pay for something, but in the end they just faked their death to pay for it.

You arrive at the scene of the crime. A few cops stand around a body while a hovering drone shines lights down on the catwalk

# Scenes

examining the body
    - give clues of places to go to investigate1
        - home of the victim
        - credit chit gives clue to go to bar

a bar where people know the victim
    - can give tip that the victim was looking to sell their life

place where they make counterfeit bodies
    - victim able to pay in small pieces

a broker selling the thing the victim paid for
    - what is that?
    - thinking like a place off world maybe? running away from problems

rich asshole who is paying for this to happen

How do we pay to go to space?

# People

Victim
Mum
Corpseller
Rich Asshole
Elon Musk(Gatekeeper to Space)
skeevy vendor guy - maybe was selling a thing the victim wanted to buy
cool street meat lady - fun flavor, gives you a tip on where to look for clues
rich family member - tied to the victim, a little aloof but interested in getting "the truth"
cop who doesn't give a shit - shows why ppl would hire someone like you. just completely useless.
there should be a bar scene - a place the victim frequented
esports? - WiiSports?
guy fieri? - is this a thing?
